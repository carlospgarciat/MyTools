# MyTools
Collection of small scripts/tools I've built to make my life easier.

## AWS-CrossRegionAMISearch.ps1

PowerShellScript used to quickly search for AMI IDs using the AWS CLI in multiple regions and output the result in a single text file.
note: I'll try format the output to an usable json... at a later time :)
